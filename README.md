<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Course
Route 256 is a free course for Junior and Middle developers in several areas (Go, C#, Testing).
Education includes lectures, workshops and homework.
At the end, those who have completed the course are offered an internship or an offer to the company. I have been trained in Go Junior. To enroll in the course, you need to pass a selection.

## Week 1
The week was devoted to the basic syntax of Go, its features and tools of work.

## Week 2
We studied working with HTTP on Go and goroutines.

## Week 3
It was told about the basics of the relational database and sql.

## Week 4
This week was devoted to concurrency and parallelism in Go and some of its patterns (pipeline, semaphore, workers, fanIn/fanOut).
Since this week, we have started working on the main project, where we applied what we learned in lectures.
I chose the Students' LMS project, where the main entities are Students, Admins and Tasks themselves.

## Week 5
Coming soon
This week we studied data storage in the database, the Repository pattern and caching in Redis, Memcached, local caches.

## Week 6
Coming soon

## Week 7
Coming soon

## Week 8
